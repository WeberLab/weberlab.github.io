# Weber Lab's Website

In order to edit the website, you should ignore most `.html` files except the main `index.html`

## Config

The `config.yml` file contains the basic information and configuration for the site (theme, title, etc.)

## _pages

In `_pages` you will find folders for the different pages (team, software, etc.). Edit the `.md` file, not the `.html` file

*Note:* Ignore the `_pages/team` and `_pages/projects` folder (see below)

## _data

To change **Team Members**, edit `_data/team.yml`

To change **Projects**, edit `_data/projects.yml`
