    <a href="https://www.bcchr.ca/aweber">Dr. Alexander Mark Weber</a> is an Assistant Professor at UBC in the 
    <a href="https://pediatrics.med.ubc.ca/">Department of Pediatrics</a>, Division of Neurology, 
    and an Independent Investigator at <a href="https://bcchr.ca/">BC Children's Hospital Research Institute</a> 
    with the <a href="https://www.bcchr.ca/research/research-themes/brain-behaviour-development"> Brain, Behaviour & Development Theme.</a> 
    His research interests focus on developing specific and sensitive quantitative biomarkers of anatomical, 
    functional and metabolic characteristics of brain health in newborns and children.
    <br>
    Novel neuroimaging applications may further elucidate the underlying pathological mechanisms associated with 
    neonatal encephalopathy, Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE), seizures, intercranial hemorrhage, or ischemic stroke. 
    Early recognition and classification combined with brain interventions are key in the prevention or reduction of 
    progressive and chronic lifelong disabilities such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and behavioural and learning disorders. 
    Currently, objective neuroimaging markers of treatment responses are urgently needed to accelerate clinical trials and 
    focus our search for effective treatments.

    Olivia was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. She completed her undergraduate degree at UBC with a Combined Major in Life Science, Physics, and Computer Science. She joined the Weber Lab in April 2020 as a co-op student for two terms and stayed on part time as a Research Assistant. In May of 2021, she started her Masters of Applied Science in the School of Biomedical Engineering. Her project involves investigating the fractal nature of the BOLD signal of resting state functional MRI signals, and its clinical and neuroscience applications.
    <br>In her spare time, she enjoys running, hiking, surfing, cross-wording, travelling, and puzzles.

    Anna was raised in Toronto, Ontario. She completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto with
    a double Major in Neuroscience and Molecular Biology. Shortly after, she began working in the provincial 
    healthcare sector conducting analysis work. During this time, she also became a technical research assistant 
    at the UHN Toronto Rehabilitation Institute (KITE Research Institute) with the Winter Lab under Dr. Geoff Fernie
    and Dr. Atena Roshan Fekr. Alongside work, she continued her academic studies and pursued a Master of Clinical 
    Science at Western University. She joined the Weber Lab in May 2021 as a Masterâ€™s of Applied Science student in 
    the School of Biomedical Engineering. Her project involves developing and investigating the cerebral metabolic 
    rate of oxygen in newborns using advanced MRI methods such as quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and arterial spin labelling (ASL).
    <br>In her spare time, she enjoys ultimate frisbee, board games, hiking, cooking, and swimming.

    Allison was born and raised in Edmonton, Alberta. She completed her undergraduate degree at the University of 
    Alberta with a Bachelor of Science with Honors in Neuroscience. Afterwards, she worked as a research assistant for 
    Dr. Lawrence Richer in the Pediatric Autonomic Clinic at the Stollery Children's Hospital. She joined the Weber 
    Lab in September 2021 for her Master's in Neuroscience in the Faculty of Medicine at UBC. Her project investigates 
    the metabolic, functional and structural pathology of Rett Syndrome though using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
    techniques of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
    <br>
    In her spare time she enjoys reading, travelling, hiking and running.

    Johann was born and raised in County Antrim, Ireland. He has completed three years of my undergraduate degree in Physics at UBC, with one more to go. Johann joined the Weber Lab in January 2021 as a co-op student. His project involves looking at the connection between sucrose treatment for preterms newborns and their fractal resting state fMRI behaviour.
    <br>In his spare time, he enjoys running, walking, cooking, history, and electronics.
