    <a href="https://www.bcchr.ca/aweber">Dr. Alexander Mark Weber</a> is an Assistant Professor at UBC in the 
    <a href="https://pediatrics.med.ubc.ca/">Department of Pediatrics</a>, Division of Neurology, 
    and an Independent Investigator at <a href="https://bcchr.ca/">BC Children's Hospital Research Institute</a> 
    with the <a href="https://www.bcchr.ca/research/research-themes/brain-behaviour-development"> Brain, Behaviour & Development Theme.</a> 
    His research interests focus on developing specific and sensitive quantitative biomarkers of anatomical, 
    functional and metabolic characteristics of brain health in newborns and children.
    <br>
    Novel neuroimaging applications may further elucidate the underlying pathological mechanisms associated with 
    neonatal encephalopathy, Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE), seizures, intercranial hemorrhage, or ischemic stroke. 
    Early recognition and classification combined with brain interventions are key in the prevention or reduction of 
    progressive and chronic lifelong disabilities such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and behavioural and learning disorders. 
    Currently, objective neuroimaging markers of treatment responses are urgently needed to accelerate clinical trials and 
    focus our search for effective treatments.

    Isabel was born and raised in Metro Vancouver and did her undergrad at UBC in Integrated Sciences (Neuroscience and Statistics). 
    To date, her work in neuroimaging has been through a cognitive science lens. She joined the Weber Lab in Sept 2024 because she wanted 
    to learn how the human brain can also be studied as a complex biological system. She is excited to be involved in a project measuring 
    the power-law characteristics of the fMRI signal. To relax, Isabel walks, runs, reads, and plays pickleball.

    Lydia was born in the US, but has spent most of her life in Vancouver, BC. She completed her Bachelor of Medical Sciences in Biochemistry at the University of Western Ontario. 
    While at UWO, she worked in two labs—the first working on machine learning models for age-related brain health and the second developing informatics software for mass 
    spectrometry-based proteomics. She started her Master of Applied Science in biomedical engineering at UBC in the fall of 2022. 
    Her research project concerns the relationship between excitatory-inhibitory neurotransmitters and brain criticality (the Hurst exponent). 
    Lydia has also spent her last three summers working clinically with children with various neurodevelopmental disabilities, e.g. autism, ADHD, etc., at the University of Washington. Lydia’s hobbies include cooking and reading.
