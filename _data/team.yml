  bio: >
    <a href="https://www.bcchr.ca/aweber">Dr. Alexander Mark Weber</a> is an Assistant Professor at UBC in the 
    <a href="https://pediatrics.med.ubc.ca/">Department of Pediatrics</a>, Division of Neurology, 
    and an Independent Investigator at <a href="https://bcchr.ca/">BC Children's Hospital Research Institute</a> 
    with the <a href="https://www.bcchr.ca/research/research-themes/brain-behaviour-development"> Brain, Behaviour & Development Theme.</a> 
    His research interests focus on developing specific and sensitive quantitative biomarkers of anatomical, 
    functional and metabolic characteristics of brain health in newborns and children.
    <br>
    Novel neuroimaging applications may further elucidate the underlying pathological mechanisms associated with 
    neonatal encephalopathy, Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE), seizures, intercranial hemorrhage, or ischemic stroke. 
    Early recognition and classification combined with brain interventions are key in the prevention or reduction of 
    progressive and chronic lifelong disabilities such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and behavioural and learning disorders. 
    Currently, objective neuroimaging markers of treatment responses are urgently needed to accelerate clinical trials and 
    focus our search for effective treatments.
