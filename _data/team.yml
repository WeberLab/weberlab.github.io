    <a href="https://www.bcchr.ca/aweber">Dr. Alexander Mark Weber</a> is an Assistant Professor at UBC in the 
    <a href="https://pediatrics.med.ubc.ca/">Department of Pediatrics</a>, Division of Neurology, 
    and an Independent Investigator at <a href="https://bcchr.ca/">BC Children's Hospital Research Institute</a> 
    with the <a href="https://www.bcchr.ca/research/research-themes/brain-behaviour-development"> Brain, Behaviour & Development Theme.</a> 
    His research interests focus on developing specific and sensitive quantitative biomarkers of anatomical, 
    functional and metabolic characteristics of brain health in newborns and children.
    <br>
    Novel neuroimaging applications may further elucidate the underlying pathological mechanisms associated with 
    neonatal encephalopathy, Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE), seizures, intercranial hemorrhage, or ischemic stroke. 
    Early recognition and classification combined with brain interventions are key in the prevention or reduction of 
    progressive and chronic lifelong disabilities such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and behavioural and learning disorders. 
    Currently, objective neuroimaging markers of treatment responses are urgently needed to accelerate clinical trials and 
    focus our search for effective treatments.

    Lydia was born in the US, but has spent most of her life in Vancouver, BC. She completed her Bachelor of Medical Sciences in Biochemistry at the University of Western Ontario. 
    While at UWO, she worked in two labs—the first working on machine learning models for age-related brain health and the second developing informatics software for mass 
    spectrometry-based proteomics. She started her Master of Applied Science in biomedical engineering at UBC in the fall of 2022. 
    Her research project concerns the relationship between excitatory-inhibitory neurotransmitters and brain criticality (the Hurst exponent). 
    Lydia has also spent her last three summers working clinically with children with various neurodevelopmental disabilities, e.g. autism, ADHD, etc., at the University of Washington. Lydia’s hobbies include cooking and reading.

    Anna was raised in Toronto, Ontario. She completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto with
    a double Major in Neuroscience and Molecular Biology. Shortly after, she began working in the provincial 
    healthcare sector conducting analysis work. During this time, she also became a technical research assistant 
    at the UHN Toronto Rehabilitation Institute (KITE Research Institute) with the Winter Lab under Dr. Geoff Fernie
    and Dr. Atena Roshan Fekr. Alongside work, she continued her academic studies and pursued a Master of Clinical 
    Science at Western University. She joined the Weber Lab in May 2021 as a Master’s of Applied Science student in 
    the School of Biomedical Engineering. Her project involves developing and investigating the cerebral metabolic 
    rate of oxygen in newborns using advanced MRI methods such as quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and arterial spin labelling (ASL).
    <br>In her spare time, she enjoys ultimate frisbee, board games, hiking, cooking, and swimming.
