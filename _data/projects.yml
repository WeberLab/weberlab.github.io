- name: Investigating Brain Dynamics and Power Law Scaling in fMRI BOLD Signals
  description: >
    Background: Since the 1990s, it has been suggested that the brain
    operates in a critical state between order and disorder. Systems that
    exist in a critical state exhibit scale-invariance, power-law
    distributions, fractal geometry, and long-range correlations. Evidence to
    support the brain criticality hypothesis comes from many different
    avenues, both spatial (dendritic branching and small-world network
    connectivity),
    and temporal (neurotransmitter release, neuronal firing, local field potentials, and MEG, EEG, and fMRI
    signals), suggesting that in the brain, criticality is the rule, not the exception. It has been further theorized
    that existing in this state maximizes signalling efficiency, storage capacity, and flexibility. Thus, being able
    to properly identify and measure criticality is a key component in trying to understand how the brain
    functions. Unfortunately, in a rush to investigate and publish findings on criticality in fMRI neuroimaging,
    a rigorous testing of the assumptions and algorithms used for these purposes has not yet been performed.
    Objective: The objective of this student project is to develop a signal-processing tool in Python that
    will: 1) test whether a signal follows a power-law distribution; 2) categorize the signal as either fractional
    Gaussian noise (fGn) or fractional Brownian motion (fBm); and 3) accurately report the signal’s Hurst
    exponent (H) value between 0 and 1. Time permitting, the tool will be used to investigate the nature of
    fMRI signals and the effects of various preprocessing methods.
    Methods: Where possible, previously published Python libraries will be used to simulate power-law
    distributed signals of known type (fGn vs fBm) and H values. An exhaustive search for previously published
    H estimation algorithms will be conducted and converted to Python where necessary. Testing will be
    performed throughout the development process to ensure reliability and performance.
    Deliverables: The following deliverables will be provided at the end of the project: 1) A signal pro-
    cessing tool that includes all of the features described above as well as: can analyze a 4D fMRI file with
    ∼250,000 voxels in approximately 10 minutes; provides easy to read visual outputs for verification and
    publication; is flexible and easy to use; has code-base that is well formatted and with easy to understand
    comments throughout; and is version controlled on a public Github repository; 2) Documentation for the
    tool, including installation instructions and user instructions; 3) Test cases and testing documentation; 4)
    A manuscript draft to be submitted for peer-review and published for wider knowledge-translation and
    dissemination.

- name: Functional, Metabolic, and Structural MRI Findings in Rett Syndrome
  description: >
    Background: Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a severe genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that typically manifests 
    in females due to de novo mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2).  Symptoms usually 
    become apparent after 6 to 18 months of age when the child begins to miss developmental milestones or 
    loses abilities they had previously gained. These symptoms typically affect nearly every aspect of the 
    child’s life. There is no cure for Rett syndrome, treatment is symptomatic only. In order to design better 
    treatment, further research is necessary to understand anatomical, neurochemical, and functional changes 
    in the brains of children with RTT, and to link these changes with measures of genetics, disease progression 
    and clinical features.
    <br>
    Aim: The primary aim of the current study will be to investigate in vivo white matter architectural (DTI) 
    and metabolism (MRS) differences between girls with RTT compared to healthy age-matched girls, as well as 
    explore the relationship between these neuroimaging measures and clinical severity scores, epilepsy severity, 
    and genetic MECP2 mutations. Secondary aims will explore functional MRI differences across RTT severity and 
    genetic mutations. This data will provide critical preliminary data for a full Project Grant application to CIHR.
    <br>
    Methods: Girls with RTT (aged 8-12 years; n = 10) will be recruited from BC Children’s Hospital (Dr. Datta and 
    Dr. Horvath’s clinics), as well as from the Provincial Rett Clinic. Healthy controls (aged 8-12 years; n = 10) 
    will be recruited from social media, and from friends of families with RTT. MRI will be acquired on the BC 
    Children’s Hospital MRI Research Facility research dedicated broadband GE 3T MRI system. EEG and biochemical 
    data will be collected as part of clinical care.
    <br>
    BB&D Theme: Our goals are aligned with the vision of BB&D to improve outcomes for developmental and mental 
    health of at risk children. This catalyst grant will help researchers Dr. Weber and Datta to collaborate on a 
    project that will gather and test new analyses of MRI and clinical/genetic data of children with complex 
    medical, developmental and mental health needs. This research is in child neurodevelopmental health.
    <br>
    Expected Outcomes: This research will help identify the structural, metabolic and functional differences between 
    girls with RTT and their healthy counterparts. These findings will be linked to specific MECP2 mutations and 
    clinical severity, allowing for a greater understanding of the specific causes of RTT, and paving the way for 
    future targeted therapies. The overarching goal will be to scale this project up after we have collected the 
    pilot data and shown proof of concept.

#   description: >
#     Brain activity exhibits a scale-invariant nature: i.e. appears the same at varying levels of
#     scale/magnification. This is shown in neuronal membrane potentials, neural field potentials,
#     electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and fMRI, and is now seen as an 
#     integral feature of the brain. Scale-invariance is seen throughout nature, is a defining 
#     feature of fractal geometry, and is associated with long-range correlation in time. In the 
#     frequency domain, this is seen as a power-law decrease of the power spectrum, and is separate 
#     but coexists with brain oscillations.
#     <br>
#     Unlike brain oscillations, scale-invariant behaviour is not well understood. Research into this 
#     field of fMRI has revealed that analysis of the signal’s scale-invariant nature enables the 
#     discrimination of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, active from inactive grey matter during 
#     a block paradigm, between rest and task, and neurological disorders. The scale-invariant phenomena 
#     of fractal signals can be completely characterized by two parameters: the variance and Hurst 
#     exponent (H). Typical Hurst values reported in the brain range between 0.5 to 1.0, with a common 
#     pattern of higher values dominating cortical regions, characterizing scale-invariant signals, 
#     and lower values seen subcortically. More persistent long-memory signals have been found to 
#     localize in the gray matter, with an average voxel-wise H of ~0.8, while white matter and 
#     cerebrospinal fluid tissue types are commonly defined by values closer to 0.5. As neuronal cell 
#     bodies reside in gray matter regions, scale-invariant temporal dynamics are suspected to originate 
#     neuronally and observed persistent scale invariance likely indicates synchronized neuronal 
#     oscillations rather than neurophysiological noise.
#     <br>
#     Scale-invariant analysis of fMRI BOLD signals remains relatively obscure, leaving much work to be 
#     done with regards to developing the best practices for analyses, in understanding and interpreting 
#     results, and the implications for neuroscience. This is where our research program aims to provide 
#     original and innovative contributions to the field.

# - name: Sucrose Therapy in Preterms A Resting State fMRI Fractal Analysis Study
#   description: >
#     Preterm and critically ill newborns admitted to a NICU undergo repeated skin-breaking procedures that
#     are necessary for their survival. In many parts of Canada, and North America, sucrose is becoming the 
#     accepted clinical standard nonpharmacologic intervention for managing acute procedural pain for these 
#     infants. Although shown to be safe in single doses, not enough studies have evaluated the effects of 
#     repeated doses of sucrose over relatively short periods of time. Furthermore, it is unclear how repeated 
#     doses of sucrose may alter functional brain development at such a critical period. Using data obtained 
#     in collaboration with Dr. Steven Miller at Sick Kids, we propose to use a novel resting state fMRI 
#     analysis method, known as Fractal Analysis, to study the fMRI brain dynamics of preterm infants who 
#     have received different doses of sucrose. This information could help us shed light on how sucrose may 
#     be altering brain signalling at a critical period of brain development.

# - name: Brain Health in Preterm Infants Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Oxygen (CMRO2) Brain Mapping
#   description: >
#     Greater understanding of cerebral brain health in sick preterm infants is an important aim of neonatal 
#     medicine. Central to this premise is the development of quantitative, reliable, and non-invasive 
#     techniques for the assessment of cerebral circulation and metabolism. However, most current clinical 
#     techniques only measure the level of oxygen delivery, and not oxygen metabolism. Measures such as 
#     cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), which provide information about the balance of cerebral 
#     oxygen delivery and demand, would have much greater clinical relevance. While there have been previous 
#     attempts to measure CMRO2 in newborns, we believe advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a 
#     combination of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and arterial spin labelling (ASL) is 
#     potentially more accurate and precise, and ultimately more useful for studying and developing 
#     therapies for brain injured preterm and term neonates.
#     <br>
#     The overarching study aims are: use QSM and ASL to improve non-invasive measures of cerebral CMRO2 
#     in very preterm infants. My lab will develop and improve our method of measuring CMRO2 in preterm 
#     children and establish their associations with clinical measures of health such as time on ventilation 
#     (ToV). This project has several phases: 1) improve protocol on scanner and collect pilot data from 
#     preterm neonates (24 to 32 weeks gestational age (GA); n = 20); 2) evaluate the relationship between 
#     CMRO2 and clinical risk factors; 3) Using data from Phases 1 and 2, conduct a larger study on very 
#     preterm (24 to 32 weeks GA; n > 50), moderately preterm (32 to 37 weeks GA; n > 50), and healthy term 
#     newborns (37 to 42 weeks GA; n > 50). 
#     <br>
#     Developing these tools and innovations will place Canada and BC at the forefront of advanced quantitative 
#     MRI imaging of newborns. The resulting techniques will benefit future patients, healthcare providers, 
#     researchers, and the overall healthcare system.
