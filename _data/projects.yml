    Brain activity exhibits a scale-invariant nature: i.e. appears the same at varying levels of
    scale/magnification. This is shown in neuronal membrane potentials, neural field potentials,
    electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and fMRI, and is now seen as an 
    integral feature of the brain. Scale-invariance is seen throughout nature, is a defining 
    feature of fractal geometry, and is associated with long-range correlation in time. In the 
    frequency domain, this is seen as a power-law decrease of the power spectrum, and is separate 
    but coexists with brain oscillations.

    Unlike brain oscillations, scale-invariant behaviour is not well understood. Research into this 
    field of fMRI has revealed that analysis of the signal’s scale-invariant nature enables the 
    discrimination of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, active from inactive grey matter during 
    a block paradigm, between rest and task, and neurological disorders. The scale-invariant phenomena 
    of fractal signals can be completely characterized by two parameters: the variance and Hurst 
    exponent (H). Typical Hurst values reported in the brain range between 0.5 to 1.0, with a common 
    pattern of higher values dominating cortical regions, characterizing scale-invariant signals, 
    and lower values seen subcortically. More persistent long-memory signals have been found to 
    localize in the gray matter, with an average voxel-wise H of ~0.8, while white matter and 
    cerebrospinal fluid tissue types are commonly defined by values closer to 0.5. As neuronal cell 
    bodies reside in gray matter regions, scale-invariant temporal dynamics are suspected to originate 
    neuronally and observed persistent scale invariance likely indicates synchronized neuronal 
    oscillations rather than neurophysiological noise.
    <br>
    Scale-invariant analysis of fMRI BOLD signals remains relatively obscure, leaving much work to be 
    done with regards to developing the best practices for analyses, in understanding and interpreting 
    results, and the implications for neuroscience. This is where our research program aims to provide 
    original and innovative contributions to the field.

- name: Sucrose Therapy in Preterms A Resting State fMRI Fractal Analysis Study
  description: >
    Preterm and critically ill newborns admitted to a NICU undergo repeated skin-breaking procedures that
    are necessary for their survival. In many parts of Canada, and North America, sucrose is becoming the 
    accepted clinical standard nonpharmacologic intervention for managing acute procedural pain for these 
    infants. Although shown to be safe in single doses, not enough studies have evaluated the effects of 
    repeated doses of sucrose over relatively short periods of time. Furthermore, it is unclear how repeated 
    doses of sucrose may alter functional brain development at such a critical period. Using data obtained 
    in collaboration with Dr. Steven Miller at Sick Kids, we propose to use a novel resting state fMRI 
    analysis method, known as Fractal Analysis, to study the fMRI brain dynamics of preterm infants who 
    have received different doses of sucrose. This information could help us shed light on how sucrose may 
    be altering brain signalling at a critical period of brain development.
