- name: Investigating the Long-Term Memory of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Time Series
  description: >
    Brain activity exhibits a scale-invariant nature: i.e. appears the same at varying levels of
    scale/magnification. This is shown in neuronal membrane potentials, neural field potentials,
    electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and fMRI, and is now seen as an 
    integral feature of the brain. Scale-invariance is seen throughout nature, is a defining 
    feature of fractal geometry, and is associated with long-range correlation in time. In the 
    frequency domain, this is seen as a power-law decrease of the power spectrum, and is separate 
    but coexists with brain oscillations.
    <br>
    Unlike brain oscillations, scale-invariant behaviour is not well understood. Research into this 
    field of fMRI has revealed that analysis of the signal’s scale-invariant nature enables the 
    discrimination of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, active from inactive grey matter during 
    a block paradigm, between rest and task, and neurological disorders. The scale-invariant phenomena 
    of fractal signals can be completely characterized by two parameters: the variance and Hurst 
    exponent (H). Typical Hurst values reported in the brain range between 0.5 to 1.0, with a common 
    pattern of higher values dominating cortical regions, characterizing scale-invariant signals, 
    and lower values seen subcortically. More persistent long-memory signals have been found to 
    localize in the gray matter, with an average voxel-wise H of ~0.8, while white matter and 
    cerebrospinal fluid tissue types are commonly defined by values closer to 0.5. As neuronal cell 
    bodies reside in gray matter regions, scale-invariant temporal dynamics are suspected to originate 
    neuronally and observed persistent scale invariance likely indicates synchronized neuronal 
    oscillations rather than neurophysiological noise.
    <br>
    Scale-invariant analysis of fMRI BOLD signals remains relatively obscure, leaving much work to be 
    done with regards to developing the best practices for analyses, in understanding and interpreting 
    results, and the implications for neuroscience. This is where our research program aims to provide 
    original and innovative contributions to the field.

- name: Sucrose Therapy in Preterms: A Resting State fMRI Fractal Analysis Study
  description: >
    Preterm and critically ill newborns admitted to a NICU undergo repeated skin-breaking procedures that
    are necessary for their survival. In many parts of Canada, and North America, sucrose is becoming the 
    accepted clinical standard nonpharmacologic intervention for managing acute procedural pain for these 
    infants. Although shown to be safe in single doses, not enough studies have evaluated the effects of 
    repeated doses of sucrose over relatively short periods of time. Furthermore, it is unclear how repeated 
    doses of sucrose may alter functional brain development at such a critical period. Using data obtained 
    in collaboration with Dr. Steven Miller at Sick Kids, we propose to use a novel resting state fMRI 
    analysis method, known as Fractal Analysis, to study the fMRI brain dynamics of preterm infants who 
    have received different doses of sucrose. This information could help us shed light on how sucrose may 
    be altering brain signalling at a critical period of brain development.

- name: Resolving clonal structure and evolution patterns in DLBCL
  description: >
    Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma is a genetically heterogeneous form of cancer, 
    with different cells in the tumour acquiring different mutations. This 
    intra-tumour heterogeneity can have profound effects on treatment; if a clonal 
    subpopulations is resistant to treatment, it will reform the tumour following 
    treatment, causing the patient to relapse. We are recieving samples from several
    clinical trials exploring different salvage therapies for patients with relapsed
    DLBCL. Tumour biopsies and liquid biopsies are being collected from patients 
    both before and after they are treated. Using these temporal sources of tumour DNA,
    we can identify clonal subpopulations in the tumour, 
    and further explore how the tumour evolves and adapts in the face of a strong 
    selective pressure such as treatment. The mutations unique to these resistant 
    clonal subpopulations can be explored to determine which mutation(s) result 
    in treatment resistance. We can further determine if these mutations are 
    detectable prior to treatment, which may allow patient to be screened for resistance 
    mutations before they are treated.

- name: Circulating Tumour DNA as a biomarker in non-Hodgkin lymphoma
  description: >
    This project aims to develop a novel way of monitoring patients with lymphoma and find a new immunotherapy regimen
    that would be effective in patients that are not cured with conventional chemotherapy. They will first genetically
    profile the tumours to determine at which time point they become resistant. They will then determine how these
    lymphomas evade immune detection and test if targeting these evasion strategies, i.e. "harnessing the immune response"
    is successful at eradicating chemo-resistant lymphoma.

- name: Comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)
  description: >
    Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare cancer that derives from B lymphocytes in the periphery (mantle zone)
    of the germinal centre. MCL is most often diagnosed at stage 3 or 4 and is typically aggressive although some patients have an indolent form of the disesae.
    Only 30-40% of patients with advanced disease achieving a complete response to frontline treatments (R-bendamustine).
    Heterogeneous clinical response is partially attributable to observable variations in morphology, immunophenotype and proliferative capacity;
    however, there is little known about the relationship between genetic features and variation in phenotype or response to specific treatment regimens.
    Through a meta-analysis of in-house and existing exome sequencing data, our group has identified multiple novel driver mutations in MCL including some that associate with high or low proliferation.
    To more completely ascertain the mutations that lead to lymphomagenesis in MCL, we are performing an integrative proteogenomic characterization of MCL tumours using a combination of whole genome sequencing, RNA-seq and shotgun proteomics.
    We will are using these data to identify novel coding and non-coding (i.e. regulatory) driver mutations that affect the natural history of MCL including treatment response.

- name: Identification and functional characterization of recurrent non-coding mutations in NHLs
  description: >
       The list of protein-coding drivers identified through sequencing in DLBCL
       has begun to saturate and yet there remains a gap in our understanding
       of how these genetic alterations contribute to the
       transcriptional differences underlying known prognostic signatures and molecular subgroups.
       For example, dysregulation of NF-κB is the hallmark feature of ABC
       DLBCL but many ABC cases appear to lack the common driver mutations
       that are known to promote NF-κB. We are seeking driver mutations
       that contribute to some features of NHLs.
       We use data-driven comprehnsive methods that allow identification of
       non-coding SSMs with a regulatory effect in cis or trans on
       genes/proteins relevant to malignancy.

- name: Comprehensive characterization of endemic and sporadic Burkitt lymphoma
  description: >
    Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is currently classified as one of three clinical
    variants: endemic BL, sporadic BL, and HIV-associated BL.
    The endemic variant is primarily diagnosed in sub-Saharan Africa and is
    epidemiologically associated with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and
    malaria infection; although, the role of these pathogens in promoting
    the formation of BL remains unclear.
    On the other hand, sporadic BL is diagnosed outside of malaria-endemic
    areas, with only a minority of cases being EBV-positive (10-30%).
    This project seeks to generate high-throughput whole genome and
    transcriptome sequencing data from over 100 BL tumours in order to
    elucidate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of the disease.
    With this project, we aim to refine the mutational landscape of BL to
    facilitate the development of less toxic targeted therapies.
    We also plan on investigating the oncogenic role of EBV and whether it may
    serve as a better criterion for disease classification than the current
    system relying on geographic origin.

- name: Genetic characterization of HIV-associated DLBCL
  description: >
    Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a common HIV-associated cancer.
    The genetic and molecular aetiology of HIV+ DLBCL has not been thoroughly explored. 
    This study seeks to characterize HIV+ DLBCL through comprehensive whole genome, 
    transcriptome, and miRNA sequencing. Enhancing our understanding of the molecular features of these 
    tumours, particularly those that distinguish them from other DLBCLs, may translate into improved
    therapies for a growing population of patients afflicted with both HIV and cancer.

- name: Genetic characterization of canine B-cell lymphomas
  description: >
    Cancer is the leading cause of premature death in pet dogs and non-Hodgkin lymphomas are the most common cancer in most dog breeds.
    Unlike human lymphomas with similar histopathology, canine B-cell lymphomas (cBCL) are incurable and exhibit an agressive clinical course.
    We are sequencing cBCLs to identify driver mutations that contribute to this cancer in a variety of dog breeds. 
    We identified TRAF3 as a novel tumour suppressor in cBCL and are pursuing additional candidate genes. 
    We are also exploring plasma from cBCLs to evaluate the utility of ctDNA as a biomarker and non-invasive source of tumour DNA in canine lymphoma.
