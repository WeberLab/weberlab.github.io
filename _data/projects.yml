- name: Functional, Metabolic, and Structural MRI Findings in Rett Syndrome
  description: >
    Background: Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a severe genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that typically manifests 
    in females due to de novo mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2).  Symptoms usually 
    become apparent after 6 to 18 months of age when the child begins to miss developmental milestones or 
    loses abilities they had previously gained. These symptoms typically affect nearly every aspect of the 
    child’s life. There is no cure for Rett syndrome, treatment is symptomatic only. In order to design better 
    treatment, further research is necessary to understand anatomical, neurochemical, and functional changes 
    in the brains of children with RTT, and to link these changes with measures of genetics, disease progression 
    and clinical features.

    Aim: The primary aim of the current study will be to investigate in vivo white matter architectural (DTI) 
    and metabolism (MRS) differences between girls with RTT compared to healthy age-matched girls, as well as 
    explore the relationship between these neuroimaging measures and clinical severity scores, epilepsy severity, 
    and genetic MECP2 mutations. Secondary aims will explore functional MRI differences across RTT severity and 
    genetic mutations. This data will provide critical preliminary data for a full Project Grant application to CIHR.

    Methods: Girls with RTT (aged 8-12 years; n = 10) will be recruited from BC Children’s Hospital (Dr. Datta and 
    Dr. Horvath’s clinics), as well as from the Provincial Rett Clinic. Healthy controls (aged 8-12 years; n = 10) 
    will be recruited from social media, and from friends of families with RTT. MRI will be acquired on the BC 
    Children’s Hospital MRI Research Facility research dedicated broadband GE 3T MRI system. EEG and biochemical 
    data will be collected as part of clinical care.

    BB&D Theme: Our goals are aligned with the vision of BB&D to improve outcomes for developmental and mental 
    health of at risk children. This catalyst grant will help researchers Dr. Weber and Datta to collaborate on a 
    project that will gather and test new analyses of MRI and clinical/genetic data of children with complex 
    medical, developmental and mental health needs. This research is in child neurodevelopmental health.
    <br>
    Expected Outcomes: This research will help identify the structural, metabolic and functional differences between 
    girls with RTT and their healthy counterparts. These findings will be linked to specific MECP2 mutations and 
    clinical severity, allowing for a greater understanding of the specific causes of RTT, and paving the way for 
    future targeted therapies. The overarching goal will be to scale this project up after we have collected the 
    pilot data and shown proof of concept.
