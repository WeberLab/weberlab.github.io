## _Branding the Brand_

_Campain dates: July 1 - August 31, 2021_

### Morin lab and affiliates will be simultaneously:
* Designing and voting for a new logo for the Morin lab
* Choosing a new tattoo that will be permanently added to Dr. Morin's body
* Asking prospective sponsors for their Terry Fox Run team [_Lymphomania_](http://www.terryfox.ca/lymphomania) to determine the size of Dr. Morin's new tattoo of the Morin lab logo through their generous donations


### Why we're doing this
* The Terry Fox Foundation has provided consistent support to the research we do in the Morin lab at SFU and BC Cancer and each year we give back by raising funds and awareness through the run
* The Morin lab has long discussed having a logo but this has never been adequately incentivized
* Dr. Morin may be having a midlife crisis, but he's made up his mind and his team is more than happy to suggest designs knowing that he will get one of them as a tatoo
