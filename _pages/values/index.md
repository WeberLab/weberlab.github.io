## Vision:

We aim to further the understanding of infant brain development and related disorders through the use of state-of-the-art MRI technology and insightful research to facilitate early identification and treatment of neurological complications.


## Mission:
Our mission is to understand the intricate processes of brain development in infants, as well as the intricacies of neurological illnesses, using quantitative MRI approaches. We foster interdisciplinary collaboration by working closely with other specialists and researchers to translate our discoveries into valuable insights and solutions. Overall, we strive to improve the well-being and quality of life for children and families affected by neurological diseases.


## Values:
**Diversity:** We value the inclusion of lab members from diverse educational, professional, and cultural backgrounds, recognizing that unique backgrounds provide enriching perspectives.

**Collaboration:** We encourage teamwork, curiosity, and independent thinking to achieve common goals and account for diverse perspectives. We embrace humility, vulnerability (i.e. being wrong), asking any and all questions, 

**Respect:** We respect all lab members and their ideas, projects, and time, fostering an environment where everyone is valued and contributions are recognized. If you have contributed to a project according to the CReDIT system, you should be listed as an author on the manuscript (see https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/credit.html). We embrace interdisciplinary science through collaboration as we acknowledge the value of expertise and perspectives in driving innovation. We respect work-life balance and boundaries, and encourage time off, taking vacations, mental health breaks, etc.

**Transparency:** We prioritize open and clear communication to promote transparency, accountability, and mutual understanding within our team and with other collaborators. This includes keeping records of your work in a central repository (e.g. the lab wiki), keeping this updated, writing enough details for others to be able to follow what you did and why.

**Open Science:** We embrace open science principles and practices, including transparency and reproducibility, to ensure the integrity and accessibility of our research findings. This includes writing and sharing code that is well documented, with comments throughout explaining each step; writing your manuscript using a reproducible method (e.g. Rmarkdown or Quarto); publishing in open access journals or as a preprint before submission to a closed access journal; 

**Innovation:** We embrace creativity by pushing boundaries to develop innovative solutions to real-life problems. We encourage all lab members to bring ideas and ask questions, regardless of ‘seniority’ or level of education. All ideas and voices are welcome and encouraged.

**Scientific Integrity:** We are devoted to maintaining integrity by adhering to lab safety rules, ethical research methods, and current metascience best-practices. These can include reducing our reliance on p-values and reporting effect sizes, confidence intervals, and bayes factors; being transparent about what was originally planned in our analysis and what was later performed as experimental analyses; not publishing in predatory or pay-to-publish journals (e.g. see https://beallslist.net/).
