    The Weberlab uses non-invasive imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to help scientists and clinicians better understand brain health and disease, and how to treat an unhealthy brain. MRIs are well suited for these purposes because unlike X-ray or a CT scan, they do not expose the recipient to harmful radiation. This means that people can be safely scanned multiple times, including babies and pregnant mothers. MRIs are can provide both detailed and diverse information about the brain, including high resolution anatomical information, details about brain activity, and measurements of the concentration of specific chemicals or metabolites. Combining the results of these scans helps us obtain a more complete picture of brain function.

    The Weber Lab is interested in improving brain imaging techniques and exploring how these techniques can be combined in novel ways to tell us something new about the brain. Ultimately, we hope that these insights can help people lead better lives by creating effective therapies for injuries and diseases of the brain.
