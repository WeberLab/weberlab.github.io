  My program aims to improve our understanding of how the brain develops in infants and how certain
  neurological disorders can affect this development. Through the use of advanced MRI techniques, my lab has been
  able to non-invasively study the brain structure and function of infants and children with a range of neurological
  conditions.

  <br>

  By studying brain development, we hope to identify early markers of these conditions and develop better treatment
  strategies. We have already made significant progress in this area, and our research has led to a better
  understanding of the underlying causes of several pediatric neurological disorders (TBI, preterm birth, spincal cord
  injury, perinatal asphysixia, white matter injuries, etc.)

  <br>

  Furthermore, my lab works closely with doctors, researchers, and other specialists to ensure that our research is
  conducted in the most effective and responsible way possible.

  <br>

  The impact of this research program is significant, as it has the potential to improve the lives of children and
  families
  affected by neurological disorders. By identifying early markers of these conditions and developing more effective
  treatments, my lab hopes to improve the prognosis for children with these conditions and reduce the burden of
  these disorders on families and society.
